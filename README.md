Author: Lydia Masabarakiza

## Overview 
This projects analysis the needs of Microsoft studio, an aspiring film studio that wants to start producing movies. Descriptive analysis of movie data sets shows the different types of movies and the other things to be considered in order for Microsoft Studio to be a success. 
Microsoft studio can use the findings to make data driven decisions.

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. Using the data from popular sites such as IMDB, The Numbers, and Rotten Tomates I am going to do an analysis on the data sets and gain actionable insights to give the CEO of Microsoft studio.

## Data 
For my project, I analyzed movie trends using data from three prominent movie sites: IMDB, The Numbers, and Rotten Tomatoes. 
Before merging, I cleaned each dataset individually, addressing issues such as missing values and standardizing formats. 
The final consolidated data set was used to perform analysis and gain insights.

## Methods 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was crucial to gaining a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's distribution and identifying potential patterns. 
Descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, provided key summary measures. 
Additionally, I utilized data visualization techniques, including histograms and scatter plots, to visually represent trends and relationships within the dataset

## Results 
Comedy|Kids and Family|Romance films were the best perfoming films according to ratings

## Conclusion
The analysis leads to four recommendations for Microsoft Studios.

- Microsoft Studios should aim at making more comedy, family and romance films. These have shown to have good rating from veiwers and also have high revenues.

- The frequency of a publisher, writer and director does not mean that they will produce the best films. Microsoft Studios should look into hiring publishers, writers and directors based on the quality of their work and encourage collaboration between the different professionals.

- The release dates and theater dates have an impact on how the movie. Movie released in other months had a higher revenue compare to others. Microsoft suites should aim at releasing movies in November and December.

- Spending more on production will not equate to having higher revenue. Microsoft studio should aim at providing quality and not going over the top with extravagant props that will cost more.

## Next Steps
Further analysis can yield additional insights such as:
- The use of Natural Language processing to understand the sentiments of the viewers reviews can help Microsoft Studios guage what the viewers like and dislike about the already existing movies and gain insights from that.

- Looking into the best performing studios and gaining insights from the various practies that make them successful.

- Use of machine learning models to perform predictive analysis on the best months and days to release movies.
